# json-parser

My own JSON tokenizer and parser, written in TypeScript.

It covers the full JSON spec (at least to my knowledge), and extends it with trailing commas, hex numbers and octal numbers.

## Disclaimer

_Don't like actually use this_, please. This is just for fun.

There's JSON.parse built into JavaScript, and there's probably a bunch of bugs in here.

So yeah, don't use this.
